          <p>
            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of <strong>ViewerFrenzy</strong> and related
            services, including <strong>viewerfrenzy.com</strong>, <strong>streamer.viewerfrenzy.com</strong>, and
            <strong>manage.viewerfrenzy.com</strong> (collectively, the "Services").
          </p>

          <p>
            The Services are developed and published by <strong>OldManObserver</strong> ("we", "us", "our").
            By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms and our
            <a class="vf-link" href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          <div class="vf-legalCallout vf-small vf-muted">
            This document is provided for general informational purposes and should be reviewed for your specific legal
            requirements.
          </div>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">1. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            You must comply with all applicable laws and platform rules (including Twitch and Steam rules). The Services
            are not intended for children under 13.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">2. Accounts and authentication</h2>
          <p>
            Some features require you to sign in with a third-party account (for example, Twitch). You are responsible for
            maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities that occur under it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">3. License and permitted use</h2>
          <p>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services for
            personal, non-commercial entertainment purposes, subject to these Terms.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where permitted by law.</li>
            <li>You may not exploit the Services, cheat, or use automation/bots in ways that harm the community or infrastructure.</li>
            <li>You may not use the Services to violate any law, infringe rights, or harass other users.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">4. Stream-enabled nature of ViewerFrenzy</h2>
          <p>
            ViewerFrenzy is designed to be played on and around live streams. Your Twitch username/display name and your
            gameplay actions/results may be shown publicly (for example: on stream overlays, in leaderboards, and on stats pages).
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">5. Community content (maps, tracks, and other UGC)</h2>

          <h3>5.1 Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            As between you and OldManObserver, you retain ownership of the original rights you have in the content you create
            and submit ("User Content").
          </p>

          <h3>5.2 License you grant to ViewerFrenzy</h3>
          <p>
            To operate, promote, and improve ViewerFrenzy, you grant OldManObserver a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
            sublicensable, transferable, irrevocable (to the extent permitted by law), and perpetual license to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>host, store, reproduce, and distribute your User Content;</li>
            <li>modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from your User Content (including for compatibility, bug fixes, balance, performance, and curation);</li>
            <li>publicly perform and publicly display your User Content (including on streams, promotional videos, screenshots, and in-game showcases); and</li>
            <li>use your User Content as part of ViewerFrenzy "official" content, including bundling it with the base game or featuring it as a curated/official map, with or without modifications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="vf-small vf-muted">
            This license is necessary so that we can run community maps at scale, cache and distribute them to players,
            and feature great creations.
          </p>

          <h3>5.3 Your responsibilities for User Content</h3>
          <p>You agree that your User Content:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>does not infringe any third-party rights (copyright, trademark, privacy/publicity, etc.);</li>
            <li>does not include unlawful, hateful, harassing, or obscene material; and</li>
            <li>does not include malware or anything intended to disrupt the Services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You represent and warrant that you have the rights and permissions needed to grant the license above.
          </p>

          <h3>5.4 Removal, takedowns, and moderation</h3>
          <p>
            We may review, refuse to publish, remove, disable, or delete User Content at any time for any reason
            (including no reason), with or without notice. We are not obligated to host or keep hosting any User Content.
          </p>
          <p class="vf-small vf-muted">
            If you believe content infringes your rights, contact us (see Section 13) and include enough information for
            us to investigate.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">6. In-game purchases, digital items, and refunds</h2>
          <p>
            ViewerFrenzy may offer optional digital items (for example: skins). Purchases are typically processed by the
            platform/store you use (for example, Steam) and are subject to that platform’s terms and refund policies.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>All sales are final</strong> except where required by law or the applicable platform’s refund policy.</li>
            <li>If a platform grants a refund, we may revoke the associated digital items/entitlements.</li>
            <li>Digital items have no real-world monetary value, are licensed (not sold), and are not transferable except where the platform explicitly allows.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">7. Updates and availability</h2>
          <p>
            We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time. We do not guarantee that the
            Services will be available at all times or that any specific feature will remain available.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">8. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms,
            engaged in abuse, or if necessary to protect the Services or community.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">9. Third-party services</h2>
          <p>
            The Services may integrate with third-party services (such as Twitch or Steam). Your use of those services is
            governed by their separate terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.
          </p>

            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OLD MAN OBSERVER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
            SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR
            INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE
            SERVICES.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">12. Governing law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Florida, without regard to conflict
            of law principles.

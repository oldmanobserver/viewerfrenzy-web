          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>OldManObserver</strong> ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses,
            and shares information when you use <strong>ViewerFrenzy</strong> (the game) and related services,
            including <strong>viewerfrenzy.com</strong>, <strong>streamer.viewerfrenzy.com</strong>, and
            <strong>manage.viewerfrenzy.com</strong> (collectively, the "Services").
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">1. Information we collect</h2>

          <h3>1.1 Twitch account information (when you sign in)</h3>
          <p>
            If you use "Sign in with Twitch", we receive information from Twitch that allows us to identify you
            and provide the Services.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>: Twitch user ID and login name.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile information</strong>: display name and profile image URL (and other public profile fields Twitch provides).</li>
            <li><strong>Access/entitlement checks</strong>: information needed to determine whether you are allowed to access gated features (for example, subscriber status on a specific channel, if applicable).</li>
            <li><strong>OAuth data</strong>: scopes granted and token expiration details. We do not intentionally store your Twitch OAuth access token on our servers; your browser/device may store session tokens to keep you signed in.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="vf-small vf-muted">
            Note: The exact fields we receive can vary depending on Twitch and the permissions/scopes you approve.
            If you grant us permission to access your email address, we may receive and store it.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Game and gameplay information</h3>
          <p>
            When you play ViewerFrenzy (including participating via stream), we may collect and store gameplay data
            to operate the game and generate leaderboards/stats.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Competition results</strong>: finishes, placements, points, races joined, wins, and other stats.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization and preferences</strong>: default vehicle selection, cosmetic selections, and related preferences you save.</li>
            <li><strong>In-game identifiers</strong>: internal IDs used to associate stats and preferences to your Twitch identity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.3 Community content (UGC) you create or upload</h3>
          <p>
            If you create or upload content (for example: community maps/tracks, map metadata like name/description,
            or other creations), we store that content and associated metadata.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Map metadata</strong>: map name, description, creator, timestamps, versioning, and configuration data.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderation status</strong>: flags such as removed/disabled or featured/official status.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.4 Purchase and entitlement information</h3>
          <p>
            ViewerFrenzy may offer in-game purchases (such as skins) processed through third-party platforms
            (for example, Steam). We do not collect or store your full payment card details.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transaction/entitlement references</strong>: purchase receipts or entitlement IDs needed to grant you items.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory state</strong>: records indicating what digital items you own in ViewerFrenzy.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.5 Technical information</h3>
          <p>
            Like most online services, we and our infrastructure providers may collect technical information
            when you access the Services.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Device and browser data</strong>: user agent, language, and similar details.</li>
            <li><strong>Log data</strong>: IP address, timestamps, error logs, and request metadata for security and troubleshooting.</li>
            <li><strong>Local storage</strong>: we use localStorage/sessionStorage to store authentication/session information in your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: we may use cookies and similar technologies required for security and basic functionality. (We do not knowingly use third-party advertising cookies for ViewerFrenzy.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">2. How we use information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide the Services</strong> (sign-in, saving preferences, showing stats, and operating competitions).</li>
            <li><strong>Personalize your experience</strong> (remember your default vehicle/cosmetics).</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate and enforce rules</strong> (prevent abuse, remove prohibited content, and protect the community).</li>
            <li><strong>Improve and debug</strong> (monitor performance, fix bugs, and develop new features).</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong> (detect fraud, protect accounts, and protect our infrastructure).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">3. How information is shared</h2>
          <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

          <h3>3.1 Public visibility (leaderboards and stats)</h3>
          <p>
            ViewerFrenzy is designed to be stream-enabled. Your Twitch display name/login and gameplay results
            may be publicly visible in leaderboards, stats pages, and on stream overlays.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 Service providers and infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            We use third-party providers to host and operate the Services (for example, hosting, databases, and
            content delivery). These providers process information on our behalf to deliver the Services.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Third-party platforms you choose to use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Twitch</strong>: authentication and (where applicable) entitlement checks such as subscription status.</li>
            <li><strong>Steam</strong> (or other storefront/platforms): purchase processing and entitlement verification.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.4 Legal and safety</h3>
          <p>
            We may disclose information if required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is
            necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect the safety of users, investigate abuse, or protect our rights.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">4. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We keep information only as long as needed to provide and operate the Services, comply with legal obligations,
            resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gameplay stats and leaderboards may be retained long-term to preserve competitive history.</li>
            <li>Removed community maps may be retained for moderation/audit purposes, but can be disabled from public access.</li>
            <li>We may retain backups for a limited time even after deletion requests are processed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">5. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information.
            However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">6. Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Services are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us
            and we will take appropriate action.
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">7. Your rights and choices</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or receive a copy of certain
            personal information we hold about you. You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            To request access or deletion, contact us using the contact method below. We may need to verify your identity
            (for example, by confirming control of the Twitch account).
          </p>

          <h2 class="vf-h2">8. Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and
